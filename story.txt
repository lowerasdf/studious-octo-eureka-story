Once upon a time, there was a small city named after its people who always thought that birds are scary, Nobirdtopia. Then one day, a time traveler appeared with his personal super computer that can also connect to the cloud system from the future. And also with all libraries backended. Everyone in the city treated him as their god, not because he's from the far future, but because he made a bird detection system such that it can be embedded to the surveillance camera, which can warn people if there is any bird detected by the surveillance camera.
However one day, a large group of birds passed this city during migration. Alerts from the detect system were everywhere. Luckily, people built an underground sanctury before and all of them went underground. There were no people on the street except the man from the future. The time traveler was in awe that his machine was not able to work. As a result, he decided to throw rocks at the birds and chop down the telephone lines they were resting on. The birds swarmed the poor time traveler, and he ended up in serious injury.
Bird is the word and the word is bird. These chants echoed through the shelter as the people listened to the fate of the time traveler. Him, being not well versed in bird law, stood no chance against the relentless judicial action levied against his estate.The birds surrounded him and dragged him out as the time traveller begged for mercy while all the birds chanted their sacred tune "bird is the word and the word is bird", they chirped, as they pecked the man with their beaks and tore his clothes apart. They had no mercy for him as they despised those who violated their sanctity. Finally, the man was beaten and bloodied and the birds were satisfied with their fine work, and began to wander off back to their respective places perched atop buildings and poles.
