Once upon a time, there was a small city named after its people who always thought that birds are scary, Nobirdtopia. Then one day, a time traveler appeared with his personal super computer that can also connect to the cloud system from the future. And also with all libraries backended. Everyone in the city treated him as their god, not because he's from the far future, but because he made a bird detection system such that it can be embedded to the surveillance camera, which can warn people if there is any bird detected by the surveillance camera.
